# Daily Check-in

Daily check-in form for my students at Perryville. Has simple React and Tailwind form and charts for responses.

Inspired by @audieannie and her "Success in Education" talk from the [CS50 Educator Workshop 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-yTArUji0&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T381My2RQGkQoiw6bdL2OpwtU&amp;index=4).


## Technology

- React/create-react-app
- TailwindCSS
- Node/Express.js
- MongoDB
- D3.js

  

## Getting Started
```
# git clone project
cd daily-check-in

# for the server, from the project root
cd server
npm install
# to run locally (as of now there is no prod version, it is running on my instructor computer)
npm run dev

# for the client, from the project root
cd client
npm install
# also running locally
npm start
```

## Todo
- Add snapshots to README
- Add HuggingFace sentiment analysis or text analysis for answers on silly questions to get data into chart friendly form
- Add year level time series charts for yearly summaries
